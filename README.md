### 

jfftpack is a Java version of fftpack. jfftpack is based
on Paul N. Swarztraubre's Fortran code and Pekka Janhuen's
C code. It is developed as part of my official duties as
lead software engineer for SCUBA-2 FTS projects
(www.roe.ac.uk/ukatc/projects/scubatwo/)

The original fftpack was public domain, so jfftpack is
public domain too. This software is in no way certified or 
guaranteed.

Please send any comments or bug reports to baoshe.zhang at
uleth.ca or baoshe_zhang at hotmail.com.
